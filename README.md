# scfernz-ui-component-library
A collection of UI components so I don't have to keep writing stuff

## Recommend running VSCode with Live Server, so far includes

- Fluid Typography using clamp() for setting up base styles - may refactor to use CSS Variables when I feel like it
- Menu hover effect with mousemove and clip-path reveal animations

## Things to add:

- Responsive Navbar from scratch
- 3 Level Navbar (not recommended from UX perspective but sometimes clients ask for it) - including Menu Dropdown Animations
- Vanilla JS accordion with only a few lines of JS
- Logo Marquee
- Button and Menu Hover effects
- Custom animations (keyframe stuff, parallax, etc.)
- Filters, clip-path animations
- Page transition animations
- Grids?
